# LazyFym
**LazyFym** is a general-purpose simulator for dynamical systems.
## Notes
### Origin
The origin of the name `Fym` is from the previous versions of flight (but also general-purpose) simulators:
[fym](https://github.com/fdcl-nrf/fym) in `Python` and [FymEnvs.jl](https://github.com/fdcl-nrf/FymEnvs.jl) in `Julia`.
### Deprecated
It has taken low priority for now to improve the simulation speed when the time span is very long.

## Features
### Flexible usage pattern and nested environments
LazyFym is highly based on Julia's pipeline syntax and [Transducers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds/Transducers.jl).
This makes it possible to construct a simulator using Transducers.
Since Transducers are composable, it is highly flexible to make your own simulator.
Also,
LazyFym supports **nested environments** so that users can deal with
complex dynamical systems.
### Lazy evaluation
It is possible to lazily evaluate your simulator.
To do so,
you would need to incorporate packages related to lazy evaluation
such as [Lazy.jl](https://github.com/MikeInnes/Lazy.jl) and [InfiniteArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/InfiniteArrays.jl).
### Parallelism
It is not seemingly different from the sequential simulation.
For example,
you can perform simulation with various initial conditions by
replacing `collect` by `tcollect` (thread-based) or `dcollect` (process-based),
which are provided by `Transducers.jl`.
You should run Julia REPL or execute codes with an appropriate option,
for example, `julia -t 4` for thread-based parallel simulation.
### Predefined environments
LazyFym provides some predefined environments for reproducible codes.
Take a look at `src/fymenvs.jl`.
<!-- ### Performance improvement for simulations with long time span (Todo; experimental) -->
<!-- (I'm trying to apply some ideas, e.g., `PartitionedSim`, -->
<!-- but it seems slower than expected.) -->

## Interface
### Types
LazyFym provides a Type `Fym`.
`Fym` contains the information of an environment (system),
probably consisting of other `Fym`s as sub-environments (sub-systems).
### With other packages
LazyFym is highly based on `Transducers.jl` so various functionalities provided by
`Transducers.jl` can be applied.
Therefore, it is **highly recommended** to get used to `Transducers.jl` for the users of LazyFym (e.g., [glossary of Transducers.jl](https://juliafolds.github.io/Transducers.jl/dev/explanation/glossary/)).
In addition,
the following list of packages would be useful:
- [Lazy.jl](https://github.com/MikeInnes/Lazy.jl) and [InfiniteArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/InfiniteArrays.jl) for dealing with lazy evaluation and infinite array
- [StructArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StructArrays.jl), [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl), and [JLD2.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JLD2.jl) for handling simulation data

### Quick start
You can also perform numerical simulations with lazy evaluation,
nested custom environments, eager or lazy data postprocessing, and parallel simulation.
Please take a look at directory `test` (some examples may be omitted).

## Performance Tips
### Provide environment information
Since LazyFym automatically calculate the information of environments (including size, flatten_length, etc.)
and may result in performance degeneration,
you should consider extend `LazyFym` functions for your custom environments such as `LazyFym.size`
to improve the simulation speed (about 2~3 times faster in most cases).
### Postprocess data after simulation
Postprocessing will make your simulator slow.
Postprocessing after obtaining simulation data would be beneficial if your simulation itself has bottleneck.
